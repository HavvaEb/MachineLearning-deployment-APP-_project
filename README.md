  ## Description
    The real estate company "ImmoEliza" asked me to predict the properties price based on the data which I have scrapped from their website. Their main request is to be created a machine learning model to predict on Belgium's real estate sales. In other words,  "ImmoEliza" has hired me to build a tool that enables the company to predict property prices using linear regression.

This project has four parts :

 model.py — This contains code for the machine learning model to predict price based on the defined features.
 
 app.py — This contains Flask APIs that receives sales details through GUI or API calls, computes the predicted value based on our model and returns it.

 request.py — This uses requests module to call APIs defined in app.py and displays the returned value.
